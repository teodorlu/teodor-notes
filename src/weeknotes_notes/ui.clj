            ;; Lessons:
            ;;
            ;; - Tests are useful, I currently hand-roll all the logic assuming
            ;;   I won't write bugs. That's a half-decent assuption /up to some point/.
            ;;   After reaching that point, guardrails / structure is required.
            ;;
            ;; - It's super-useful to be able to run something like clj-reload
            ;;   to sync files and REPL.
            ;;
            ;; Actions:
            ;;
            ;; - Tests -- I don't want to write those for now.
            ;;
            ;; - REPL state / files sync: I want to address that now. First
            ;;   integrant and integrant/repl. Then use integrant/repl and
            ;;   clj-reload together.
